title: "$CHAR Token"
---

The `$CHAR` token is the native utility token for the **vChars DAO**, launched as a VRC-20 on the Vana blockchain. It powers data access, incentives, and economic alignment between contributors, consumers, and the broader vChars ecosystem.

---

## Token Utility

### 1. Access to Data

- Data consumers pay in \$VANA or other tokens to access datasets curated by vChars DAO.
- These payments are automatically **converted into \$CHAR** via on-chain routing.
- From there:
  - **80% of \$CHAR is burned**, reducing supply and increasing scarcity.
  - **20% is sent to the Vana network** as a protocol fee.

This creates a **deflationary mechanism** tied directly to real demand for data.

---

### 2. Rewarding Data Contributors

- vChars DAO determines how to reward contributors who help grow and refine the dataset.
- Rewards may include:
  - Uploading conversations
  - Fine-tuning agents
  - Improving metadata or labeling
  - Referring active users

> The core principle is simple: **the more value contributors bring to the data ecosystem, the more \$CHAR they can earn.**

Reward methods will evolve over time and be governed by the DAO.

---

### 3. Governance & DAO Participation

- \$CHAR will be used to participate in DAO decisions over:
  - Reward distribution frameworks
  - Dataset access rules
  - Partnerships and integrations
- Governance logic is modular and upgradeable, allowing vChars to evolve governance mechanisms as it scales.

## Token Allocation (WIP)

The token allocation is still being finalized. Here’s what’s confirmed so far:

| Category   | Allocation | Vesting                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team**   | 15%        | 6-month cliff, 2-year linear                                   |
| **Others** | TBD        | Will include ecosystem, treasury, rewards, and liquidity pools |

More details will be published as tokenomics design progresses.

## Integration with Vana’s Data Architecture

- vChars is fully integrated with **Vana’s Data Access Layer**.
- Access requests, payments, and conversion flows are handled through Vana’s infrastructure.
- This ensures interoperability with other DataDAOs and aligns \$CHAR with Vana-wide network standards.
