At vChars, we ensure the integrity, authenticity, and quality of your data using advanced verification mechanisms, all while keeping your privacy intact. Below, we outline the secure and transparent process behind data verification.

## üîí **Your Data, Your Privacy**

* **Encrypted Data Only**: Your data never leaves your device unencrypted. All processing and validation occur in a secure environment, ensuring that only you have the right to disclose your information.

* **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Data validation is performed inside a secure enclave, protecting it from unauthorized access or tampering.

***

## ‚úÖ **The Verification Process**

vChars AI employs a **Proof of Contribution** mechanism to evaluate and verify your data. Each dataset is validated across four key traits:

### 1. **Uniqueness**

We ensure your data is original by generating a cryptographic hash of the dataset and comparing it against existing hashes stored securely on Filebase.

* If the hash is unique, your contribution is accepted.

* Otherwise, the data is flagged as a duplicate.

### 2. **Ownership**

Ownership is verified through cryptographic checks using your Telegram WebApp data:

* A secure hash is generated from your Telegram metadata and compared to your submission.

* The process ensures the Telegram ID in the data matches your identity, confirming you own the data.

### 3. **Authenticity**

Authenticity checks verify the type of conversation data provided:

* Only valid data types, such as **personal\_chat** or **ai\_chat**, are accepted.

* This ensures that the data matches the expected format and use case.

### 4. **Quality**

We analyze the quality of your dataset based on the following factors:

* **Content Quality**: Measures the ratio of meaningful messages versus empty or incomplete ones.

* **Time Quality**: Penalizes large gaps in message timestamps or invalid date formats.

* **Interaction Quality**: Evaluates engagement levels, such as replies and interactive content.

Each component is scored individually, and an overall quality score is calculated using weighted averages.

***

## üìä **How Data is Scored**

The final score is determined as follows:

* **Quality Score**: 60% weight

* **Ownership Verification**: 40% weight

* **Validity**: Data is considered valid only if the uniqueness score is 100%.

Detailed stats and quality metrics are provided to you upon verification.

## üåê **Built on Vana**

vChars operates on **Vana**, the blockchain designed for user-owned data. This means:

* **Decentralized Trust**: Vana‚Äôs network ensures transparency and fairness in data validation.

* **Secure Infrastructure**: Vana‚Äôs robust architecture, coupled with features like staking and governance, supports reliable and user-centric operations.

With vChars and Vana, you can trust that your data remains **yours**, secure, and valuable.
